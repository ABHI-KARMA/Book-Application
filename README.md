# Book-Application
This is a small BOOK WEB APPLICATION using DJANGO
In this application we have a Book Seller user and Customer user, the Book seller user can CREATE, UPDATE and DELETE a book and can see their purchased books,
and the Customer user should have to create an login Id, and see all the book he/she can BUY, and can also see all bought books.
